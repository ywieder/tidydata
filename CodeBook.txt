TidyData Code Book

This Code Book lists the variables in the cleandataset.csv file,
explanations for how the variables were developed, and other relevant
information for the tidydata.R script used to create the tidy dataset.

Variables:

activity.label -> contains a label for the activity being done by the 
		  subject for the row.  Ex: “WALKING”, “LAYING”.  Developed
		  by mapping the activity labels in the 
		  /UCR HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt file to the
		  /UCR HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt and 
		  /UCR HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt files

subject ->        contains the subject ID for the current record.  From the
 		  /UCR HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt and 
		  /UCR HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt files

measurement variables -> the rest of the variables are measurement variables
                         from the /UCR HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt and 
		         /UCR HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt files.  For
 			 descriptions of the variables, please read the 
			 UCI HAR Dataset documentation.  Each variable in the
 			 cleardataset.csv file contains the average value			 for that measurement for the particular group of
			 activity.label and subject in each row.  The units
   			 for the measurement variables are Hz


Other Processing Information:

the tidydata.R cookbook assumes the UCI HAR directory is located in the 
current working directory for the R session.  If you want to replicate the 
tidy dataset creation, please move the directory into your current working
directory.  Also, the script depends on subdirectories with the UCI HAR
directory, so please leave subdirectories as is

The tidydata.R cookbook will write cleandataset.csv to the current working
directory
